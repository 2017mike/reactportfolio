# React Portfolio
This is an example of my portfolio that was built using React. It displays an about page, portfolio page, and contact page. The contact page contains a submission input where anyone can put their details in to contact me. 

## Challenges

Doing front-end work with React is very new to me, so it was very difficult at first to do even the most basic of things which I am used to with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, getting a static image to display was difficult because I had to import it as a constant and set the image source as a variable. While there was some difficulty, I am now more comfortable using React and am looking forward to getting to learn more about it.
